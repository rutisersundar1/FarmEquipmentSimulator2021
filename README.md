# FarmEquipmentSimulator2021
A game written in MatLab that simulates rather expensive farm equipment.

Welcome to Farm Equipment Simulator 2021!

Gameplay instructions:
You are a farmer flying your rocket to plow a field. To get more points, fly closer to the ground or at a larger angle from vertical.
The game ends when you crash, so try to fly for as long as possible!

Using the A and D keys, rotate your rocket left and right.
Using the W and S keys, increase and decrease your throttle.
The Z key sets full throttle and the X key will cut your throttle.

Keep an eye on your fuel with the meter on the left. If your fuel runs out, you will fall and crash!
To replenish your fuel, hit cows that are wandering around your field to get more methane to burn!
Remember that when you have more fuel, your rocket is heavier and will accelerate more slowly with the same amount of thrust.

To pause, press the escape key. When paused, crashed, or in the title screen, press the Q key to close the game.
